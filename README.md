# Fooba
Fooba is a mobile application designed to improve food security by streamlining food bank operations. The app allows users to browse available food items, place orders, track their requests, and communicate with support staff. This project was a collaborative effort at Navario Enterprises, where I worked alongside a talented team of developers to bring this solution to life. Special thanks to the team of engineers for their contributions to the development and success of this project. This repository contains the source code for the features I was responsible for during the development of Fooba. The full application source code is not included, as it is a collaborative project developed for a client.

The checkout screen provides users with a smooth and intuitive ordering experience. Users can review their selected food items, confirm their details, and submit their requests for pickup or delivery. The interface ensures a hassle-free process with clear order summaries and confirmation prompts.


# Order Tracking

The order tracking feature allows users to monitor the status of their requests in real time. Orders move through different statuses such as "Pending," "Processing," "Ready for Pickup," and "Completed." This ensures users stay informed and reduces uncertainty about food availability.

The live chat functionality enables direct communication between users and food bank staff. This feature is essential for answering user questions, providing assistance with orders, and ensuring a smooth experience. Messages are updated in real time to keep conversations active and efficient.


# User Profile
The user profile section allows users to manage their personal details, view order history, and update their preferences. This ensures that returning users have a personalized and seamless experience when interacting with the app.
