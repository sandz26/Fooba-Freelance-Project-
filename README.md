# Fooba
Fooba is a mobile application designed to improve food security by streamlining food bank operations. The app allows users to browse available food items, place orders, track their requests, and communicate with support staff. This project was a collaborative effort at Navario Enterprises, where I worked alongside a talented team of developers to bring this solution to life. Special thanks to my colleagues for their contributions to the development and success of this project. Mr Thulani was leading the Project alongside Mr Linda.

The checkout screen provides users with a smooth and intuitive ordering experience. Users can review their selected food items, confirm their details, and submit their requests for pickup or delivery. The interface ensures a hassle-free process with clear order summaries and confirmation prompts.

# Order Tracking

The order tracking feature allows users to monitor the status of their requests in real time. Orders move through different statuses such as "Pending," "Processing," "Ready for Pickup," and "Completed." This ensures users stay informed and reduces uncertainty about food availability.

# Recommendations
Encourage users to rate movies, particularly those with few ratings and infrequent raters.
Consider users' watch time; movies with low watch times might indicate dissatisfaction.
