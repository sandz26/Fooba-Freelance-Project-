# Fooba
Fooba is a mobile application designed to improve food security by streamlining food bank operations. The app allows users to browse available food items, place orders, track their requests, and communicate with support staff. This project was a collaborative effort at Navario Enterprises, where I worked alongside a talented team of developers to bring this solution to life. Special thanks to my colleagues for their contributions to the development and success of this project. Mr Thulani was leading the Project alongside Mr Linda.

# Recommendations
Encourage users to rate movies, particularly those with few ratings and infrequent raters.
Consider users' watch time; movies with low watch times might indicate dissatisfaction.
